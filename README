Gadget client programs by Boris Gjenero <boris.gjenero@gmail.com>

This contains client programs for using several hardware gadgets I built.
It is all together in one Git repository due to interdependencies.
Gadget microcontroller firmware is distributed separately. See the links
below.

Since the gadets are unique, the whole thing won't be useful to others
as-is. Particular components may be useful for other projects.

Common components
-----------------

build : Files used in the build process

serio : Serial port library
    This is used by all direct interfacing libraries for dealing with the
    serial port in a platform-independent way. It is the oldest component
    here. Internally, global variables are used, so one copy of serio
    can only be used by one application at a time.

signd : For accessing a sign from multiple applications using TCP
    This is used when building the TCP daemons for particular gadgets.
signd/daemon : Common files for building a daemon
    In Windows it runs as a tray application via tray42 by Michael T. Smith.
signd/client : Common files for building a library for accessing the daemon

pluginapi : Application plugin API files
pluginapi/winamp : Files for building Winamp plugins

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ledsign : LED sign
http://dreamlayers.blogspot.ca/2011/11/my-led-sign.html

ledsign/libledsign : Direct interfacing library
    Requires Ruby and GNU Octave for building.
ledsign/tools : Tools for LED sign
ledsign/lsd : TCP daemon for LED sign and client library for daemon.

The following communicate via the lsd daemon:
ledsign/gen_led : Winamp plugin printing track name after track change.
ledsign/lsp : CGI program for printing on the LED sign from the web.
    Requires cgic library: http://www.boutell.com/cgic/
ledsign/JSDraw : Old JavaScript program for drawing on the LED sign
    Very inefficient, and there is no program for uploading images.

rgblamp : RGB lamp
http://dreamlayers.blogspot.ca/2011/10/my-msp430-based-rgb-light.html

rgblamp/librgblamp : Direct interfacing library
rgblamp/vis_rgb : Winamp and Audacious visualization plugin
rgblamp/winrgbchoose : Application for setting lamp colour in Windows

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

vfd : VFD gadget
http://dreamlayers.blogspot.ca/2011/11/my-vfd-display-project.html

vfd/libvfd : Interface library
vfd/vfd_plugin : Winamp and Audacious visualization plugin
    Winamp can normally only run one visualization plugin, so this also
    builds a DSP plugin. All plugins also display some system information.
vfd/vfdd : TCP daemon for VFD display
